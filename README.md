# Flick Pick 

The go-to app to end all struggles to find that one movie to watch on a Friday night. Fellow movie lovers, aren't we tired of finding ourselves in situations where no one can decide or no one wants to take responsibility for selecting a movie?
Flick Pick was created with Tomy Reyes and Devashish Shrestha over our shared love for movies and also to provide a learning experience while building a React web app using Web APIs and Material-UI.

## My roles include the following:
+ structuring the project into modular components
+ creating navigation between components
+ integrating the automatic display of results in the movie search bar
+ implementing MovieDB's Web API for retrieving the latest popular movies for the home page and movie details
+ enhancing user interaction using components such as Cards and Modals from Material-UI
+ making the Watchlist to allow users to easily add and remove movies
+ optmizing performance and responsiveness on mobile devices 

## Features
+ Search for any movie
+ View movie details including release date, rating and plot summary.
+ Add and remove movies to and from your Watchlist
+ Randomly select a movie from your Watchlist
+ Randomly select a movie based on a combination of genres and earliest release year
