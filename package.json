Fellow movie lovers, aren't we tired of finding ourselves in situations where no one can decide or no one wants to take responsibility for selecting a movie?\r Flick Pick was created with Tomy Reyes and Devashish Shrestha over our shared love for movies and also to provide a learning experience while building a React web app using Web APIs and Material-UI.",
